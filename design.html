			<h2>Flow diagram with navigation and structure</h2>
			<p><em>The main aim of our website is for guests to book our activities</em> to reduce their stress level and find a balance between their working life and life with friends and family again. We wanted our whole website to be focused on this aim to get as many activity bookings as possible. Therefore, we created the following workflow and navigation structure for our website: 
			<img src="images/Workflow.png" alt="Navigation structure" class="img-fluid">
			As you can see, almost every page of the website leads to <i>booking</i> an activity. We wanted to emphasize this even more by creating a clear button leading to the booking page directly in the navigation bar.
			<br>
			<br>
			Besides, we wanted to put focus on the <i>activities</i> and the broad choice range we have within the activity section. With a dropdown-item for the activities, guests have the opportunity to go directly to the activity they prefer or to read through all of them. We divided the activity section is the four locations we provide as LeafTime: Forest, Beach, Mountains, and Camping. All the pages lead again to the option to book the activity from there.
			<br>
			<br>
			The <i>reviewpage</i> is meant for all guests to share their experience or read about the experience of others. We think this is an important feature for brands like LeafTime, because it can make new guests more enthousiastic and give people an insight of what they can expect from their activity. On top of that, it gives us as LeafTime an clear overview of what people think of us and what we could improve if needed.
			<br>
			<br>
			The <i>About Us</i> page is also an important page of our website. Especially for new guests this page is useful. People need to know who we are, what we stand for, and why we are valuable. Furthermore, our contact information and location is stated on this page. Guests should be able to reach us if they have questions or doubts. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The <i>sidebar</i> that is always visible throughout the website is the information stated that can be helpful on everypage. These include links to our social media profiles, contact information, and the calendar with activity dates marked with circles around them. This gives the guest a clear overview from the first time they see the website. 
			</p>
			</div>
		
		<div class="row">
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>This is the general lay-out of all the pages we created: 
			<img src="images/Wireframe.png" alt="Wireframe" class="img-fluid">
			<br>
			For our websites a few features have to visible all the time while going through the website. This information is stated in the navigation bar and the sidebar. (The green sections in the wireframe). Also the header and the footer are always visible on the website. 
			<br> 
			The <i>header</i> shows the logo including our brand message / slogen. We think every guest should keep us in mind while going through the website. 
			<br>
			The <i>footer</i> shows links to our advertising policy, a disclaimer, and our design justifications. Guests are always able to click on these links, no matter what page they are on. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The color <i>GREEN</i> is the main color of our website, because our brand is focused on <i>nature</i>. Green is the color of life. It stands for growth, harmony, freshness, safety, fertility, and environment. Especially, giving our guests a fresh look on life and their environment again matches the values of LeafTime. To have a appealing green contrast in the Website, we use three different types of green together with black and white. The different green colors are based on the colors used in the Logo and Brand Road Map. See the colorcodes downs below:  
			<img src="images/Colorcodes.png" alt="Colorcodes" class="img-fluid">
			</p>
			</div>
		
		<div class="row">
			<h2>Fonts</h2>
			<p>The fonts were chosen based on the Brand Road map. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<ins>Title and H1 in header (h1): Shadows into the light</ins>
			<br> 
			The title and header 1 font is a special Google font The fonts. It is a handwritten font that makes it playful to read. We choose this font because it fits the logo of the polaroid. To stay consitent we the logo, we decided to use this font for all titles and header 1 throughout the website. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<ins>Header 2 (h2): Open Sans Condensed-light</ins> 
			<br> 
			The font for header 2 is a bit more basic and therefore easier to read. It is a softer font without any extra brackets or curls on the text. It is stated nicely within the text and shows the different subtitles in the website.  
			<br>
			<br>
			<ins>Plain text (p): Open Sans</ins>
			<br> 
			The font for the plain text is even more basic and easy to read. This makes the website clear for every user. It maches the font of header 2, but without 'condensed-light'. 
			</p>

			<h3>User Testing Report</h3>
			<p>For the user testing all team members asked 2 people from our target group to do three different tasks. This means a total of eight people have tested the website before we started building it. The tasks were very diverse and included the most important features of our first prototype of the website.
			<br>
			<br>
			The three different tasks were the following:
			
			<ul>
				<li><i>Book an activity in the mountains</i></li>
				<li><i>Write a review about LeafTime</i></li>
				<li><i>Check if there is an activity on the 22nd of April</i></li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>We printed the drawn wireframes (showns in the carousel) on paper and started by giving the test user the homepage. Based on the steps the user took we gave him/her the next page. We thought this method would be the most efficient, because it is like testing the real website, but on paper before we start building the real website. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The documentation of the User Testing analysis can be found here: *insert link to PDF*

			<h2>Issues and Improvements</h2>
			<p>The main issue we found was that there was no possibility to write a review, but only read reviews. Therefore, we created a section within the reviewpage for guests to write reviews as well. Now reviews can be written and read from the homepage AND reviewpage. 
			<br>
			<br>
			When booking an activity there was no button to finalize or confirm the booking.Therefore, we added a "BOOK NOW" button at the booking page as well. Our guests can complete their booking now.  	
			<br>
			<br>
			Less clicks to book an activity were recommended by our testers, so we combined the activity page per location in one click. We also added a button that leads directly to the booking page in the navigation bar. Every activity has a BOOK NOW button underneath. On top of this, the carousel in the homepage has direct links to booking an activity on that location. To summarize, there are <ins>four</ins> direct options to book an activity now. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The calendar on the side bar an appreciated feature for most test users. Therefore, we included the calendar is the activitypage and bookingpage as well.
